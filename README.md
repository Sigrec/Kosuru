# Kosuru
A discord bot that scrapes websites for manga or light novel data for a user inputted series based on a given region. Then it compares prices for each available volume across the websites and outputs a list of the volumes with the lowest price. Users can additionally filter out initial volumes based on stock status (PO, BO, OOP, OOS).
